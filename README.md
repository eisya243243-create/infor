## Finding the Radius of a Circle

The radius of a circle can be found through various methods depending on what information is available. Below are some methods to calculate the radius from diameter, circumference, area, and the circle equation:

### 1. From Diameter
The diameter (D) of a circle is twice the radius (r). Thus, to find the radius, you can use the following formula:

\[ r = \frac{D}{2} \]

**Example:**  If the diameter of a circle is 10 cm:
- Radius = 10 cm / 2 = **5 cm**

### 2. From Circumference
The circumference (C) of a circle is calculated by the formula:

\[ C = 2\pi r \]

To find the radius from the circumference:
\[ r = \frac{C}{2\pi} \]

**Example:** If the circumference is 31.4 cm:
- Radius = 31.4 cm / (2 × 3.14) = **5 cm**

### 3. From Area
The area (A) of a circle can be expressed as:

\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

To find the radius from the area:
\[ r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} \]

**Example:** If the area is 78.5 cm²:
- Radius = \( \sqrt{78.5 cm² / 3.14} \) = **5 cm**

### 4. From Circle Equation
The standard equation of a circle centered at the origin is:

\[ x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \]

By rearranging this equation, you can find the radius if you know any point (x, y) on the circle:
\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

**Example:** If a point on the circle is (3, 4):
- Radius = \( \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} \) = **5**

### Conclusion
These methods allow you to compute the radius of a circle using different given parameters. Knowing any one of the circle's characteristics will enable you to determine its radius effectively.
